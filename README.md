## How does it work?
*(Upon install the package installer will probably mention that it can not check the app, so it might not be safe to install.<br>Upon install the app buttons are configured for the apps that are normally started by the button)*<br>
1. Open the "Fyt HW OneKey" App and configure the preferred app by its package name.

**General Configuration screen**<br>

<br>
**Specify the apk by package name**<br>
*(Here in the "Configure the Media Button")*<br>

<br>
2. Exit the app. This is important otherwise the key capture does not work correctly!<br>
3. Press the hardware button on your unit.<br>
4. The first time you press the hardware button, for example the Media button, it will present you with 2 options: Complete action with "Music Player" or "FYT HW OneKey Media button". If you select the second option, you will get the option "Once" and "Always".
